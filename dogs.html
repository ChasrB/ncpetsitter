        <div class="span9">
            <h2>Dog Care</h2>

<p>Dogs are “man's best friend” for a reason. They are loyal and loving pack animals that mostly just want to find a happy place in your family. They usually aim to please because that gets them the extra pat or belly rub that they so look forward to as a part of their pack's social behavior. Each breed is different, but they all get lonely when their humans are gone.</p>

<p>When I come to care for your dog, they actually get more than the time that you have paid for because I believe that they should be properly greeted and fussed before I even reach for the leash. Most pet owners do not open the door and immediately send their dog out. They give love and attention to their dog, then continue that interaction into their outdoor time and care. Owners who hire me are guaranteed that their pet receives the full amount of exercise time requested, plus a five to ten minute buffer of introduction and farewell time. No person would want to have a stranger come to their door, pull them to a gym, then drop them back home without sharing some kind of conversation. I don't believe your dog enjoys that either.</p>

<p>If your dog is unable to do much exercise, I remain with them in the home for the full requested time, reading to them or talking to them. It is my firm belief that having an audible presence in the home eases the anxiety of feeling alone and helps with your dog's emotional balance while you are away.</p>

            <p><strong>Rates:</strong></p>

            <p>$10 Hour Walk/Play Time Includes:

            <ul><li>Food and water check.</li>

                <li>Introduction and farewell time.</li>

                <li>A full hour of walk, companionship, and enrichment activities.</li>

		<li>Digital map of walk, including duration and distance traveled.</a>

                <li>Care of any medical needs.</li>

                <li>Real time updates with photos or walk maps.</li>

                <li>Written documentation of care given each day and total cost.</li>

		<li>Emergency card stating you have pets at home, containing my contact information.</li>

                <li>Mail and newspaper collection. (If needed.)</li>

                <li>Plant care. (If needed.)</li></ul></p>


            <p>$5 Half Hour Walk/Play Time – This is an excellent option for anyone who needs lunch-time care or has a schedule conflict that keeps them from returning home at their usual time. Everything listed above is included in this price.</p>


           <p>$15 One and One Half Hour Walk/Play Time – This is the perfect choice for someone with a more energetic dog that needs one long walk at a certain time of day to get their energy out. It can be combined with the $5 rate to accommodate the needs of your dog's exercise routine and your schedule. Everything listed above is included in this price.</p>

            <p>$25 Per Night Boarding – This option is for owners who are comfortable having their dog stay in my home. I do have two dogs, a cat, and rats, so please keep that in mind when choosing this option. I require a meet and greet with your dogs and proof of shots before boarding. Everything listed above is included in this price, as well as a country setting, with quiet roads, fresh air and friends to play with, however 24 hour care is only available on weekends and holidays, by request.</p>

            <p>$30 Per Day Unlimited Care – This option is perfect for dogs that require more time from the humans who are caring for them. It covers multiple visits per day that are two hours or more in length. Everything listed above is included in this price, however 24 hour care is only available on weekends and holidays, by request.</p>

            <p>$35 Per Night Overnight Care – This option is for owners who prefer to have someone spend the night with their dog in their home. Everything listed above is included in this price, however 24 hour care is only available on weekends and holidays, by request.</p>
        
<p>Please see my <a href="policy.html">Emergency Policies</a> page for severe weather care information and my <a href="additional.html">Additional Rates</a> page for information on fees regarding travel or for special situations.</p>
