                 <h1>Mirrani's Pet Sitting and Boarding</h1>
             </div>
        </div>
        <div class="span9">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Are you a professional?</strong></p>

<p>If you are asking if I have had official training by a professional pet sitter, veterinarian, or pet trainer, the answer is that I have had some. Throughout the years our vet has taught me much about home animal care, including wound and seizure care. I have also had lessons in dog training. This is training I have had on my own pets, not in a classroom.</p>

<p>If you are asking if I have had pet care courses, the answer is yes. I occasionally take NAPPS (National Association of Professional Petsitters) training classes online. This training includes reading a non-fiction book that the Association has chosen as the "textbook" and tests the reader by asking questions as they complete the book. These courses require a passing grade to get a certificate. All of my certificates can be found <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ncpetsitter/certifs.html">here.</a> </p>

<p>I also complete an online course in pet CPR and First Aid regularly, which requires a test on each section of training. Students must make the passing grade in order to obtain their certificates and the badges that are displayed on their websites.</p>

<p><strong>Are you a member of NAPPS or any other organization?</strong> </p>

<p>I do not personally believe in paying dues to an organization simply to have the word "professional" written somewhere on my website. I believe that my professionalism toward my customers and the quality of care I give to their pets speaks for itself much more than a stamp on my page that says I purchased the right to have the title. </p>

<p><strong>Are you insured?</strong></p>

<p>I am currently not insured, simply because the time that I work is not equal to the cost of the insurance. Many pet care providers are not insured. There are many reasons for having insurance, but most pet care providers who are not using this as their primary income prefer to have waivers or other forms for the pet owner to sign.  In most states, the homeowner's insurance is the primary carrier because the sitter has permission to be in the home. Therefore the homeowner's insurance carrier will pay and the sitter will be liable for the deductable. Many sitters also keep forms for the vet stating that the owner is willing to authorize a certain amount of pet care cost to their account while they are away. I give my versions of these forms to all new clients.</p>

<p><strong>Are you bonded?</strong></p>

<p>A bond is meant to protect employers that have hired dishonest pet care workers who might steal or commit other dishonest acts while working for them. Since I am the only care provider, using no employees, I am not bonded and do not need to be. As a teacher, I am required by law to keep my criminal background check up to date in my school's file. That record can be made available on request. (The same is true for my emergency care provider.)</p>

<p><strong>Can I have 24 hour care?</strong></p>

<p>My main job as a teacher prevents me from giving 24 hour supervision on weekdays, however on weekends and holidays it is possible to arrange 24 hour care. This must be requested in advance, so that I can properly book your pet for the 24 hour time slot. I can not guarantee 24 hour care will be available every weekend or holiday, but I will do my best to make the time for you based on your needs and my schedule. The earlier you book 24 hour care, the easier it is to reserve that time.</p>

<p><strong>Are you the only sitter providing care?</strong></p>

<p>My spouse has experience with many types of animals, including having volunteered with dog trainers in the UK. This is the person I trust most in an emergency and should something happen to me, this will be the person who takes over care until other arrangements can be made with your emergency contact. My spouse is also in the house with me while pets are boarding and provides companionship for them when I am called out of the house to care for another pet. We are both teachers, so neither of us is available 24 hours on a weekday, but when public schools are closed, at least one of us will be available to your pet throughout the day or for the 24 hour period that was requested on booking. </p>

<p><strong>How much time will the emergency care provider spend with my pet if you are away?</strong><p>
If I have a boarder in my home, I prefer to stay with that animal for as much time as possible because I am the sitter that you hired to care for your pet. Before I leave the house I make certain that your pet's needs are fully seen to so that it is only companionship that my spouse will be providing in my absence. Should an emergency occur and I am physically unable to care for your pet, my spouse will take full responsibility of your pet until your emergency contact has taken over the care of your pet.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you board?</strong></p>

<p>Boarding pets are kept in my own home. Caged pets have their own room, away from any other pets in the house. </p>

<p><strong>How many pets do you board at once?</strong></p>

<p>I keep only one family of pets at a time in my home. Once I am booked for boarding on any given day, that day becomes unavailable for other clients to book as a boarding date. </p>

<p><strong>Will you still walk my dog while you have a boarder?</strong></p>

<p>I do continue to book other pet care services while I have a boarder in my home. The boarding pet remains in my house while I care for any other animals in their own homes. Boarding pets will not be left alone for more than the amount of time agreed upon by their owners at the time of booking. On weekends and holidays, my spouse (who is my emergency care provider) will remain in the home to provide companionship for your boarding pet while I am away.</p>

<p><strong>What happens in an emergency?</strong></p>

<p>My emergency policy page is located <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ncpetsitter/policy.html">here</a>. It includes multiple plans covering various situations. If you feel I have left something out, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ncpetsitter@earthlink.net">email me.</a></p>

<p><strong>Any other questions?</strong></p>

<p>I add to these questions as I get them. If I have forgotten something that should be here, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ncpetsitter@earthlink.net">email me.</a></p>
